Prezziez is a universal wishlist gifting concierge platform that allows users (giftees) to receive gifts from family, friends, fans, etc. (gifters) from any Ecommerce website that allows for shipping to a giftee’s provided address. Prezziez also allows for group gifting wherein multiple gifters may contribute towards the purchase of big-ticket items.
