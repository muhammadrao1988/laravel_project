        </ul>
        <h2 class="privacy-pg-heading"><span class="privacy-pg-number">5.</span> Cookie Policy </h2>
        <p class="privacy-pg-text">Cookies are small bits of text data placed on your device when you visit sites. Cookies record data about your activity, such as which pages you view and what you click on. Cookies assist our Platform to recognize your device when you return. For example, cookies can help us to remember your preferences, username, analyze the performance of our Platform and recommend content that may be most relevant to your interests.</p>
        <p class="priv-pg-text">Here are the reasons we may use cookies:</p>
        <ul class="privacy-pg-content">
          <li class="privacy-pg-listing privacy-pg-new"><span class="inner-pg-span">a.</span> Analytics. This type of cookies shows us which pages users view, which links are popular, etc. These cookies only provide anonymized information that does not identify anybody personally. This information is then bundled with the similar information from the other users, so that we can analyze the general usage patterns.</li>
          <li class="privacy-pg-listing privacy-pg-new"><span class="inner-pg-span">b.</span> Essential cookies. These are necessary to provide the services that you have asked for. Without these essential cookies, our Platform would not be able to operate. They are necessary to enable users to navigate through the Platform and use its main features. E.g., essential cookies identify registered users so that they can access member-only areas of the site. Essential cookies keep users logged in. If a subscriber disables essential cookies, that subscriber won’t be able to get to all of the content that a subscription entitles them to. These cookies don't collect information that could be utilized for the purposes of marketing or figuring out what places on the internet you have visited. </li>
          <li class="privacy-pg-listing privacy-pg-new"><span class="inner-pg-span">c.</span> To improve your browsing experience. This type of cookies enables the site to remember users’ preferences and settings, such as geographic region or language. They can also be used to restrict the number of times an ad is shown, to remember which forms you have already filled in, so that you don’t have to do it again. </li>
          <li class="privacy-pg-listing privacy-pg-new"><span class="inner-pg-span">d.</span> To implement tracking technology on our Platform. This tracking does not use your personal information; it uses deidentified data (i.e., data that cannot be tied specifically to you). We will not combine this data with your other personal information without your prior express permission.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="privacy-pg-text">There is a way to turn off cookies by going to your browser’s Help or Settings menu. However, keep in mind that disabling cookies may limit your use of the Platform and/or delay or affect the way in which it operates.</p>
        <h2 class="privacy-pg-heading"><span class="privacy-pg-number">6.</span> Data Security </h2>
        <p class="privacy-pg-text">Only our administrators are allowed to access our Platform’s password-protected server where your personal information is stored.  We utilize SSL. However, any transmission of information over the Internet has its inherent risks, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. Transmit personal information over the Internet at your own risk. We shall not be liable for circumvention of security measures or privacy settings on the Platform. It is your responsibility to keep your login credentials, if any, confidential.</p>
        <h2 class="privacy-pg-heading"><span class="privacy-pg-number">7.</span> Children’s Privacy </h2>
        <p class="privacy-pg-text">We do not knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. Our Platform is not directed to children under the age of 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided any personal info, it will be erased from our database as soon as reasonably possible, except when we need to keep that information for legal purposes or to notify a parent or guardian. However, portions of this data may remain in back-up archives or web logs even after we erase it from our databases. If a parent or guardian believes that a child has sent us personal information, send us an e-mail.</p>
        <h2 class="privacy-pg-heading"><span class="privacy-pg-number">8.</span> Users’ Rights, CCPA</h2>
        <ul class="privacy-pg-content">
          <li class="privacy-pg-listing privacy-pg-new"><span class="inner-pg-span">a.</span> We will not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes to the extent it is forbidden by law. If our practices change, we will do so in accordance with applicable laws and will notify you in advance. California law requires that operators of online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal. Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked.   We respond to Do Not Track signal using industry pro-privacy standards.</li>
          <li class="privacy-pg-listing privacy-pg-new"><span class="inner-pg-span">b.</span> You can request disclosure of your information collected by us by writing to the email at the end of this Policy. We will then provide the requested information, its sources and purposes of use, in a portable and easily accessible format within 45 days of the request.</li>
          <li class="privacy-pg-listing privacy-pg-new"><span class="inner-pg-span">c.</span> You have the right to request deletion of your personal information from our systems by submitting a request to the email at the end of this Policy.</li>
          <li class="privacy-pg-listing privacy-pg-new"><span class="inner-pg-span">d.</span> You have the right to nondiscrimination for exercising your rights. That means you cannot be denied goods or services, charged different prices, or provided different quality of goods/services for asserting your legal rights.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="privacy-pg-heading"><span class="privacy-pg-number">9.</span> International Transfer</h2>
        <p class="privacy-pg-text">We process your personal information in the Unites States where we are based.  To support our Platform, we may use third-party service providers in the Unites States and in other countries. Therefore, personal information may be transferred to, stored on servers in, and accessed from the United States and other countries which may be different from the one where the personal information was initially collected.</p>
        <h2 class="privacy-pg-heading"><span class="privacy-pg-number">10.</span> Accessing and Correcting Your Personal Information </h2>
        <p class="privacy-pg-text">You can view and edit some of your account information yourself after logging in. If you choose to terminate your account, we may retain some information for as long as necessary to evaluate Platform usage, troubleshoot issues, resolve disputes and collect any fees owed.  If you have any questions or wish to ask to access, modify or delete any of your personal data on our Platform, please contact us.
